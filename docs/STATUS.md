# Status — updated 2026-09-28
Phase: 2 — Blueprint (starting) | Phase 1 gate: APPROVED by Owner 2026-09-28

## Done
- Kit copied; legacy code in /legacy/APP (confirmed = legacy `main`, production logic); vision filled
- Discovery docs in docs/01-discovery (inventory, routes-and-pages, data-model, features, roles-and-permissions, notifications, integrations, i18n, risks-and-debt)
- Owner answered Q-002…Q-057 (2026-09-28) — docs/01-discovery/open-questions.md → "Answers" + "Follow-up answers"
- **Phase 1 Discovery gate approved by the Owner on 2026-09-28**
- Branch rule: legacy `main` = live production; `staging` = dev/test (0.01 GEL payments) — never base rules on staging

## Key Owner decisions (details in open-questions.md)
- Fees: no gig/project commission, no tax; withdrawal fee Standard 10% / Premium 0%; BOG card surcharge 2.5%; all admin-configurable (new Commission & Fee module)
- Escrow: buyer charged immediately; freelancer sees HOLD/Pending; one escrow payment per project (legacy milestone rows → project payments); auto-release 72h after delivery if buyer silent (configurable, on by default)
- Removed: milestones, hourly projects, paid promotions/bid upgrades, levels/badges, "Become a seller", 28 foreign gateways, Binance bot, findip/ip-api
- Every user is buyer + freelancer; ratings/reviews for gigs AND projects; freelancer sets mandatory "number of revisions" per gig/proposal
- Payments: BOG + Wallet; bank transfer coded but off; Points buy Premium only (100 = 1 month); manual withdrawals now, BOG Payout-ready design
- Promo codes: referral codes + admin codes (% or fixed GEL) on platform fees / Premium only
- Proposals require Premium (server-side); plan limits admin-editable; award acceptance 48h (configurable)
- i18n: /en/ URL prefixes, Latin allowed with Georgian, fall back to Georgian when English missing, keep legacy English values
- NEW: email 2FA toggle, renewal reminder 2–3 days before charge, multiple admin notification recipients (default ir.gvazava@gmail.com), full custom-offer flow (toggle), admin chat visibility, admin points add/deduct, blog kept + working sitemap
- Security: all keys in .env; strict web-root isolation (logs/config never web-reachable); keep restrictions, appeals, IP banning, KYC

## In progress (agent → task)
- Phase 2 kickoff: orchestrator to break Phase 2 into tasks

## Blocked
- none (schema comes from migrations + models; no production dump — accepted by Owner)

## Next up
- orchestrator: plan Phase 2 (Blueprint) — break into tasks and order the agents
- product-analyst: specs in docs/02-specs from discovery + Owner answers
- solution-architect: new schema + ledger design (freelancer HOLD balance, points ledger, configurable fees/limits/timers), URL scheme with /en/ + 301s, ADRs, openapi.yaml
- ui-ux-designer: design system from live site + legacy CSS

## Decisions waiting for Owner
- none
